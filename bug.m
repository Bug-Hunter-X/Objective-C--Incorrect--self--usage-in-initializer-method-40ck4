This code snippet demonstrates a potential issue in Objective-C related to incorrect use of `self` within a method and how it can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.  Specifically, it involves accessing instance variables before `self` is properly initialized within an initializer method like `init`. 

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject

@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;

- (instancetype)init {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        // Incorrect: Accessing myString before it's initialized
        NSLog (@"My string: %@", self.myString); // This will print null 

        // Correct: Initialize myString before usage
        self.myString = @"Hello, world!";

         // Now safe to use myString
        NSLog (@"My string: %@", self.myString); // This will print "Hello, world!" 
    }
    return self;
}

@end
```
